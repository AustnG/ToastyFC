          {TEAM_NAME} was founded in the fiery pits of friendly competition, forged by a shared love for the beautiful game (and perhaps an unhealthy obsession with perfectly toasted bread). What started as a casual kickabout among friends quickly evolved into something more... organized? Well, somewhat.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The real story begins in 2022, when {TEAM_NAME} burst onto the Bowling Green Futsal (BGF) league scene. Originally sparked by Austin Greer, a seasoned BGF veteran looking for a fresh start after earlier team ventures, the idea for a new competitive squad began to brew. After the league's return post-pandemic in 2021, Austin teamed up with Goran Omerdic. Recruiting old friends and local soccer talent, they built a team ready to make its mark in BGF Division B.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          And mark they did! In their very first year, {TEAM_NAME} blazed a trail to victory, clinching the BGF 2023 Spring Season Championship. This early success has only fueled their hunger for more. As {TEAM_NAME} continues to chase glory and returns to the BGF, we're just getting warmed up! Keep an eye on our socials to follow the journey.

                The longer story is that when registering for a team in the BGF, Austin did not have a name ready when filing the paperwork. Being a fan of the Mortal Kombat franchise - and the "Toasty!" easter egg - it's what first came to mind, and the rest is history! ðŸ”¥
